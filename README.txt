Within the backend you have a button in the fe_user table to quickly login as this fe user in frontend.
If you have a frontend user with the same email adress as your backend user you get an icon in the top toolbar menu.
If you have several fe_user accounts with the same email address you get the all shown.
Configuration for displayed infos in the icon you get within the EM.
